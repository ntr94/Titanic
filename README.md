# TITANIC
Basic Data Analysis of Titanic Passenger Dataset 

## Introduction
Hello everybody.
This is my first project in the process to become a Data Analyst, it's also my first time on Github.
In the future I will upload more cool things.

## Explication
The project consists of using a csv file of the Titanic and from there cleaning the data and drawing graphs on the data.


## Streamlit
I use Streamlit as presentation mode to be able to see the graphics of the titanic.
